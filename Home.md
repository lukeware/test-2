Welcome to the PDG Poetry Project! 

We aim to publish PDG Poetry on the web so people all over the world can enjoy it. This project is our first foray into re-publishing Public Domain poetry and images. We have created a whole new development team to make this project a reality, and we're counting on you to get things together.

## Project Statement
The purpose of this project is to create an engaging online archive of poetry and images that can be easily enjoyed by our users and easily expanded as we publish new content.
